Summary
=======

Yoolk Liquid is a Rails Engine that contains liquid filters, drops, and tags for Yoolk Instant Website. It also provides sandbox models for [yoolk_instant_website_sandbox](https://github.com/yoolk/yoolk_instant_website_sandbox/). These models read data from json files.

It was originally developed by [Chamnap Chhorn](http://github.com/chamnap), and it is currently maintained by him.

This engine depends on:

1. [liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) from Shopify
2. [liquid-rails](https://github.com/yoolk/liquid)
3. [themes_on_rails](https://github.com/yoolk/themes_on_rails)
